# Healthcare_report
A Health Report is a structured summary of healthcare-related data that provides insights into patient demographics, medical conditions, admissions, financials, and test outcomes. It helps administrators, doctors, and policymakers monitor trends, identify issues, and make informed decisions to improve healthcare delivery.
This dashboard highlights several key metrics: 21,811 patients, 21,898 doctors, and a total billed amount of ₹2,77,36,721.40. Filters for gender and insurance providers (Cigna, Medicare, UnitedHealthcare) allow targeted analysis.
The line chart “Total Patient by Months” shows seasonal variations, with peaks in November (104) and July (101), and dips in February and June (75 each). Admissions are fairly balanced across Urgent (386), Emergency (385), and Elective (368). Medical conditions reveal Obesity (197) as most prevalent, followed by Diabetes and Hypertension (182 each). Test results are categorized into Abnormal, Inconclusive, and Normal, with Normal outcomes trending slightly higher.
Gender distribution is partially represented, with 1,089 male patients noted. A year filter (2019–2024) enables longitudinal analysis, with 2021 currently selected.
- Pivot Table: A pivot is a data summarization tool that allows users to reorganize and analyze large datasets quickly. In healthcare, it can group patient records by condition, admission type, or insurance provider to reveal patterns.
- Charts: Charts are graphical representations of data, such as line charts, bar charts, and pie charts. They make complex information easier to interpret by showing trends, comparisons, and distributions visually.
- Slicer: A slicer is an interactive filter used in dashboards or pivot tables. It enables users to dynamically narrow down data—for example, selecting patients by gender, insurance provider, or year of admission—making analysis more flexible and user-friendly.
